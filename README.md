# Pokemon TicTacToe

A project I made for fun to improve on my first Tic Tac Toe project, a lot more DRY and the logic to find the winner is a lot easier to understand if I were to give another person the code to read.

# To do

[ ] Implementing an AI that can challenge the player (doesn't have to be unbeatable, just has to utilise some logic)
[ ] Make the sliding UI more mobile friendly

# Resources used

1. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/)
2. [Pokemon Sounds from the GBA and 3DS games](https://www.sounds-resource.com/3ds/pokemonsunmoon/)
