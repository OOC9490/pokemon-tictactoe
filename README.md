# Pokemon TicTacToe

A project I made for fun to improve on my first Tic Tac Toe project, a lot more DRY and the logic to find the winner is a lot easier to understand if I were to give another person the code to read.

## What I have learned

- Better use of combining css and javascript to manipulate the DOM
- Keeping my code DRY by constantly trying to refactor code where it is repeated

## To do

- ~~Implementing an AI that can challenge the player (Minimax algorithm - I will have to refactor how the game board/ win state is determine so I can more easily account for the columns and rows for making the AI move.)~~ (Using Tic Tac Toe's logic i designed a non-algorithmic, smart computer).
- ~~Make the sliding UI more mobile friendly~~
- Network Multiplayer? (I'm not sure this is worth it for this kind of game, but the learning experience would be pretty valuable!)
